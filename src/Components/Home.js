            <h1>What is Dead Cells?</h1>
            <p>
                Dead Cells is a rogue-lite, Castlevania-inspired action-platformer, allowing you to explore a sprawling, ever-changing castle… assuming you’re able to fight your way past its keepers.</p>
            <p>To beat the game, you’ll have to master 2D "souls-lite combat" with the ever-present threat of permadeath looming. No checkpoints. Kill, die, learn, repeat.</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>RogueVania:</strong> Intense 2D action with the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath in a castle full of cuddly creatures.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Souls-lite combat:</strong> Pattern-based bosses and minions, weapons and spells with unique gameplay. Roll roll roll your boat gently down the stream...

                    <li>
                        <strong>Nonlinear progression:</strong> Unlock new levels with every death, take a new path. Tired of the stinking sewers? Why not take the ramparts?

                    <li>
                        <strong>Exploration:</strong> Secret rooms, hidden passages, charming landscapes. A fine place for a holiday.
